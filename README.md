# unihack22_andromeda: DJ PAL 

DJ PAL matches your music to the mood of the room. 

The concept is simple: DJ Pal uses facial recognition to survey the general mood and atmosphere of the room. It then dynamically adjusts the music - either to match the vibes or try and fix them.

DJ Pal is just phase 1 of our moodSense technology which has wide-sweeping applications from booking the best events, to screen-testing movies, to politicians testing speeches.
